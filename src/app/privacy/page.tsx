              Listing text, links, confirmed vehicle details, reports and form
              drafts are saved in this browser. Inspection requests and contact
              messages may include the name, phone, email and location you
              enter. Selected images retain only file names, sizes and types;
              image contents are not uploaded.

              Forms do not send this information to a report provider,
              inspector, payment service or support team. Anyone with access to
              this browser profile may be able to see saved information.
              Standard requests for the website itself still occur when you load
              pages.

              seller information. Avoid using a shared browser for sensitive

              This removes AutoCheck QC listings, reports, inspection drafts and
              contact messages from this browser, including older saved
              versions. Close other AutoCheck QC tabs first so they do not save
              an open draft again.
